# apolo-thing-mock
Code to mock sensors and other devices to test an IoT API

To run this project you need to copy the `config.json.template`, remove the `.template` part and fill it with your data.

Then just run `yarn start` and you should see a message on your console saying that the devices were successfully registered on the server (don't forget to have it running).
